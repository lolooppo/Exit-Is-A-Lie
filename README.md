The game utilizes OpenGL for the graphical interface and employs a randomized depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for maze generation. Players can experience unique mazes with each playthrough, enhancing the game's replayability and excitement. This project demonstrates proficiency in both graphical programming and algorithmic maze generation.
