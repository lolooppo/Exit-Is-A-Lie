# maze_runner_v2
### Description:
This 2D maze solver game challenges players to navigate through a randomly generated maze within a 1-minute timer. The game utilizes OpenGL for the graphical interface and employs a randomized depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for maze generation. Players can experience unique mazes with each playthrough, enhancing the game's replayability and excitement. This project demonstrates proficiency in both graphical programming and algorithmic maze generation.


### How to play:
OK, it is alittle bit hard to say it, but you have just to use your keyboard arrows :).
