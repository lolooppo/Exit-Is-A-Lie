# maze_runner_v2
### Description:
This 2D maze solver game challenges players to navigate through a randomly generated maze within a 1-minute timer and it will visualize the solution if he loses. The game utilizes OpenGL for the graphical interface and employs a randomized depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for maze generation and backtracking depth-first search (Backtracking DFS) to solve it. Players can experience unique mazes with each playthrough, enhancing the game's replayability and excitement. This project demonstrates proficiency in both graphical programming and algorithmic maze generation and solving.


### How to play:
OK, it is a little bit hard to say it but, you have only to use your keyboard arrows :).


### Installation:
Install any MinGW c++ compiler and set up opengl library, then install the project and finally run it.
